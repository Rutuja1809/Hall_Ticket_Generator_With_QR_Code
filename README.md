# Hall_Ticket_Generator_With_QR_Code
developed a Hall Ticket Generator application using the Spring Boot framework, Java, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML, and CSS technologies. 
The main objective was to streamline the hall ticket issuance process for students, administrators, and teachers.

The project's flow begins with student registration, where students can create an account and login to access the application's features. Once logged in, students are presented with a default form that they must fill out with required information. Upon form submission, they are directed to the home page.

To apply for a hall ticket, students can choose exams and make a request. This request is then sent to the admin for approval. 
The admin has the authority to manage students,  Before a student can request a hall ticket, the admin first creates an exam and defines its syllabus.Once the admin approves the hall ticket request, the system generates the hall ticket, which contains a unique QR code for each student. Students can access and download their hall ticket by scanning the QR code.

The application also allows the admin to search for hall tickets using a student's seat number, which helps in efficient management and retrieval of hall ticket information.
